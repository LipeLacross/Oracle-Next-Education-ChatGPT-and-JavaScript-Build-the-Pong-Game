## üåê Deploy

To deploy the project and make it available online, you can use free platforms like **GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**:

### 1. **GitHub Pages**
- Upload the project files to a GitHub repository.
- Go to the repository settings.
- Under **Settings > Pages**, configure the `main` branch (or the branch containing the project) to serve the site.
- After a few minutes, your project will be available at the provided GitHub Pages link (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`).

### 2. **Vercel**
- Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Click **New Project** and import your GitHub repository.
- Configure the basic options and click **Deploy**.
- Vercel will generate a unique link to access your project (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).

### 3. **Netlify**
- Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Drag and drop the project folder into Netlify's deployment interface.
- Wait for the publication and access the automatically generated link (e.g., `https://your-project.netlify.app`).

### Deployment Requirements
- Ensure all project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, sounds, and images) are organized correctly.
- Adjust relative paths in the code if necessary to ensure all files are accessible in the online environment.
- Test locally before deploying to avoid compatibility issues.

Choose the platform that best suits your needs and publish your project to share it with the world!
